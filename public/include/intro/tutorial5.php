                Each round you have a <b>guaranteed income of 1000 ECU </b>(experimental currency units). In addition, each round you can earn an <b>extra income </b>of up to <b>1000 ECU </b>based on your performance in an effort task. This results in a possible total income of 2000 ECU per round. Your task will be to indicate the amount of tax you decide to pay.

                An <b>audit</b> can take place to check whether you have paid all tax due. The chance to be audited is provided as a percentage. If you did not pay enough tax you will have to pay back the missing amount and pay an additional fine (see below).

                <b>Fine level</b> is what you have to pay in case you did not pay all of your tax due and get audited. The fine level is determined based on what percentage of your tax due you evaded.
