            <span class="textSpan">
                Each round you have a <b>guaranteed income of 1000 ECU </b>(experimental currency units). In addition, each round you can earn an <b>extra income</b> of up to <b>1000 ECU </b>based on your performance in an effort task. This results in a possible total income of 2000 ECU per round. Your task will be to indicate the amount of tax you decide to pay.

            <span class="textSpan">
                The <b>tax due</b>, your chance of getting checked (<b>audit probability</b>), and the potential <b>fine</b> for detected evasion will <b>vary</b> each round, so carefully read all the information.            <br>

            <span class="textSpan">
                Tax rate is the percentage of your income you have to pay as tax. It determines the <b>tax due</b>, the concrete amount you have to pay as tax.            </span>
            <br>
            <span class="textSpan">
                An audit can take place to check whether you have paid all tax due. The <b>audit probability</b> is provided as a percentage. In case of an audit, if you did not pay enough tax you will have to pay back the missing amount and pay an additional fine (see below).
            </span>
            <br>
            <span class="textSpan">
                Fine is what you have to pay in case you did not pay all of your tax due and get audited. The <b>fine</b> is determined based on how much of your tax due you evaded.

                Information on whether you have been audited and whether this audit results in a fine will be communicated after each round.
