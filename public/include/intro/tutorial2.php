        <span style="font-size:16px;"><span class="textSpan">This study consists of about 20 rounds. Each round starts with an effort task in which you will earn money based on your performance. After that you receive information about the tax due based on your income, and you have to make a decision about how much tax you pay. Your actual payment will be based on one of the rounds, which will be randomly selected.

All data obtained from participants will be kept anonymous. There will be no record that links the data collected from you with any personal data from which you could be identified (e.g., your name, address, email, etc.). Once anonymized, these data may be made available to researchers via accessible data repositories and possibly used for novel purposes. The data will be stored for 10 years. </span>
